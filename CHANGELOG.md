- Explicit requires `dry-monads` >= 1.x, just for convenience

BREAKING CHANGES:

- The arrays of exceptions to catch is now received using the `only` argument key, e.g. `ToResult(only: [ArgumentError])`
- Setting the global `on_error` with a non-callable object (an object that does not respond to `call`) will raise `TypeError`

NEW FEATURES:

  `ToResult(on_error: Proc { |e| puts e })`

- Adds a global `configuration` object for ToResult
- Adds `on_error` field in `configuration` to execute a block every time a error is catched
